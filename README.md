# pathfinding-tests
This repo contains my time learning, testing and experimenting with path-finding algorithms within Unity and C#. Download a release to begin playing with the demos or take a look at my source code. 

# A* Pathfinding
The A* pathfinding algorithm is a very performant algorithm for finding paths. It is a commonly used algorithm in games to allow NPCs and more to move according to their environment. 

# Simple Pathfinding Algorithm
The first implementation of pathfinding I did was a very basic and brute-force method of calculating paths. It's incredibly inefficient however it does work. Visit the
