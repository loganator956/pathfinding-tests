# pathfinding-tests
This repo contains my time learning, testing and experimenting with path-finding algorithms within Unity and C#. Download a release or switch branch to view source code.  

# A* Pathfinding
The A* pathfinding algorithm is a very performant algorithm for finding paths. It is a commonly used algorithm in games to allow NPCs and more to move according to their environment. Visit the [branch](https://github.com/loganator956/pathfinding-tests/tree/a-star)

# Simple Pathfinding Algorithm
The first implementation of pathfinding I did was a very basic and brute-force method of calculating paths. It's incredibly inefficient however it does work. Visit the [branch](https://github.com/loganator956/pathfinding-tests/tree/simple)
